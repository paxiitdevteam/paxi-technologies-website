---

## Scope of IT Support Services

This section describes the IT Support Services included in this proposal. Services are provided on an ongoing basis as a managed service.

### Help Desk Support

Paxi Technologies provides help desk support for [Client Name]'s technology users. Support is available during [defined hours, e.g., business hours, extended hours, or 24/7] to address questions, troubleshoot issues, and provide guidance on technology use.

Support requests are received through defined support request channels and are tracked and managed through our support process.

### Remote and On-Site Support

Most IT issues can be resolved remotely, providing faster response times and less disruption to operations. When remote support is not sufficient, Paxi Technologies provides on-site assistance to address hardware problems, network issues, or situations requiring physical access to equipment.

On-site support is provided at [Client Name]'s primary location at [address]. Additional locations may be covered as specified in the service agreement.

### Device and Network Support

- Desktop and laptop computers

Support includes troubleshooting, configuration, updates, and maintenance to keep systems running smoothly and current.

### User and Access Management

---

## Service Delivery Model

### Ongoing Managed Service

IT Support Services are provided as an ongoing managed service. This means Paxi Technologies is responsible for maintaining and supporting the defined technology infrastructure on an ongoing basis, not just responding to problems when they occur.

The service relationship includes regular communication, proactive maintenance, and consistent support delivery.

### Response Expectations

Response times are defined based on issue priority:

- **Critical Issues**: [Response time, e.g., 1 hour] - Issues that completely prevent business operations
- **High Priority Issues**: [Response time, e.g., 4 hours] - Issues that significantly impact productivity
- **Standard Issues**: [Response time, e.g., 1 business day] - Issues that affect individual users or non-critical functions
- **Low Priority Issues**: [Response time, e.g., 2 business days] - Minor issues or requests

Response time is measured from when the support request is received until initial response is provided. Resolution timeframes depend on issue complexity and are communicated as work progresses.

### Documentation and Accountability

Paxi Technologies maintains documentation of:

- Support requests and resolutions
- System configurations
- Maintenance activities
- Changes made to systems
- Support history

This documentation provides accountability, ensures continuity, and helps resolve issues more efficiently.

### Contract Term

This agreement is effective for an initial term of [term length, e.g., 12 months] beginning on [start date].

After the initial term, the agreement will automatically renew for successive [renewal period, e.g., 12-month] periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least [notice period, e.g., 30 days] before the end of the current term.

Either party may terminate this agreement for cause with [notice period, e.g., 30 days] written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within the notice period.
