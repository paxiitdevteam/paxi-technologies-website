---

## SCRIPT 1: Initial Discovery Call Script

### Opening and Framing

**Opening Statement:**

"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm [Name] from Paxi Technologies. I understand you're looking for IT services, and I'd like to learn more about your situation so we can determine if there's a good fit."

**Framing:**

"Our goal today is to understand your IT needs and challenges. I'll ask some questions about your current situation, and then we can discuss whether our services might be a good match. Does that work for you?"

### Agenda Setting

**Agenda Statement:**

"Here's how I'd like to structure our conversation:

- First, I'll ask about your business and current IT situation
- Then we'll discuss the specific challenges or needs you're facing
- Finally, we can determine if there's a fit and what next steps might make sense

Sound good?"

### Discovery Questions

**Business Context Questions:**

1. "Can you tell me a bit about your business? What industry are you in, and roughly how many employees do you have?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "What does your business do day-to-day?"
   - "How long have you been in business?"

2. "What role does technology play in your business operations?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "What systems or software do you rely on most?"
   - "How would you describe your current IT setup?"

**Current IT Situation Questions:**

3. "How are you handling IT support or IT management right now?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "Do you have internal IT staff, or are you using external help?"
   - "What's working well with your current approach?"
   - "What's not working as well?"

4. "What IT challenges or problems are you experiencing?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "How often do IT issues interrupt your business?"
   - "What happens when something breaks?"
   - "Are there specific areas where you need more help?"

**Problem Clarification Questions:**

5. "When you think about your IT needs, what's the biggest concern or priority right now?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "What would need to change for you to feel better about your IT situation?"
   - "What's driving you to look for help now?"

6. "Are you dealing with ongoing IT support needs, or are you facing a specific project or decision?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "Is this about day-to-day operations, or something more specific?"
   - "Is there a timeline or deadline involved?"

7. "What happens if these IT challenges aren't addressed?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "What's the business impact of the current situation?"
   - "How is this affecting your team or operations?"

**Decision-Making Context Questions:**

8. "Have you looked at other IT service providers, or is this early in your search?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "What are you hoping to find in an IT partner?"
   - "What's important to you in selecting someone to work with?"

9. "Who else is involved in making decisions about IT services at your organization?"

   *Follow-up prompts:*
   - "Who would need to be part of this conversation?"
   - "What's your decision-making process typically like?"

10. "What would a successful outcome look like for you?"

    *Follow-up prompts:*
    - "If we could help solve this, what would that mean for your business?"
    - "What would you need to see to feel confident moving forward?"

### Problem Clarification

**Clarification Techniques:**

- "Let me make sure I understand—you're saying [paraphrase what you heard]. Is that right?"
- "Can you help me understand more about [specific point]?"
- "When you mention [specific challenge], what does that look like in practice?"

**Avoid:**
- Jumping to solutions
- Suggesting specific services before understanding the need
- Making assumptions about what they need

### Next Step Positioning

**Neutral Close:**

"Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've told me, I think we might be able to help, but I'd like to make sure we're looking at the right service for your situation."

**Next Step Options:**

- If service is clear: "It sounds like [Service Name] might be a good fit. Would it make sense to schedule a follow-up call to discuss that in more detail?"
- If service is unclear: "I'd like to understand a bit more about [specific aspect] to determine which of our services would be the best fit. Can we schedule a brief follow-up?"
- If not a fit: "Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure we're the right fit for what you need right now. I'd be happy to point you toward resources that might be more helpful."

**No Pressure Language:**

- "There's no obligation—we can just explore whether there's a fit"
- "Let's see if this makes sense before we go any further"
- "I want to make sure we're looking at the right thing for your situation"

## SCRIPT 2: Service Qualification and Routing Script

### Purpose

This script helps determine which service applies: IT Support Services, IT Project Management Services, or IT Consulting Services. Use this after initial discovery to route prospects to the appropriate service.

### Qualification Signals: IT Support Services

**Key Signals:**

- Ongoing IT problems interrupting business
- Need for day-to-day IT help
- Slow response times from current IT support
- Managing IT support through multiple vendors
- Internal IT staff needs additional support
- Frequent computer or network issues
- Need for help desk or technical support
- Ongoing maintenance and monitoring needs

**Qualification Questions:**

- "Are you looking for ongoing IT support to handle day-to-day issues?"
- "Do you need someone available when IT problems occur?"
- "Is this about maintaining systems that are already in place?"
- "Are you experiencing frequent IT issues that need quick response?"

**Routing Statement:**

"It sounds like you need ongoing IT support for day-to-day operations. Our IT Support Services provide ongoing technical assistance, help desk support, and proactive maintenance. Would it make sense to discuss that service in more detail?"

### Qualification Signals: IT Project Management Services

**Key Signals:**

- Specific IT project or initiative
- Multiple vendors need coordination
- Project timelines slipping
- Budget concerns on a project
- Need for someone to own project delivery
- Implementing new systems or upgrades
- Migrations or major changes
- No one accountable for project success

**Qualification Questions:**

- "Are you working on a specific IT project or initiative?"
- "Do you have a project with a defined start and end date?"
- "Are you coordinating multiple vendors or parties?"
- "Do you need someone to own the project and ensure it's delivered successfully?"
- "Is this about getting a specific project completed, not ongoing support?"

**Routing Statement:**

"It sounds like you have an IT project that needs accountable project management. Our IT Project Management Services provide project ownership, coordination, and delivery oversight. Would it make sense to discuss that service in more detail?"

### Qualification Signals: IT Consulting Services

**Key Signals:**

- Evaluating technology options or vendors
- Need for independent assessment
- Planning IT investments
- Uncertain about which direction to take
- Need guidance before making decisions
- Reviewing vendor proposals
- Assessing current IT environment
- Strategic planning or roadmap needs

**Qualification Questions:**

- "Are you looking for guidance to help make a technology decision?"
- "Do you need an independent assessment before committing to a solution?"
- "Are you evaluating options and want objective advice?"
- "Is this about understanding your options before you decide what to do?"
- "Do you need help planning IT investments or evaluating vendors?"

**Routing Statement:**

"It sounds like you need independent IT guidance to make informed decisions. Our IT Consulting Services provide assessments, analysis, and recommendations to support your decision-making. Would it make sense to discuss that service in more detail?"

### Boundary-Check Questions

**When Service Is Unclear:**

- "Help me understand—is this about ongoing support, a specific project, or getting guidance on a decision?"
- "What's the primary need: keeping systems running day-to-day, managing a project, or getting advice on what to do?"
- "Is there a specific project with a start and end date, or is this ongoing?"

**When Multiple Needs Surface:**

- "I hear you mention both [need A] and [need B]. Which one is the priority right now?"
- "It sounds like there might be two different needs here. Let's focus on the most urgent one first."
- "Which of these challenges is causing the most immediate impact on your business?"

### Clear Routing Statements

**For IT Support:**

"Our IT Support Services are designed for ongoing day-to-day IT support. This is separate from project work or consulting. If you need ongoing support, that's what we'd focus on."

**For IT Project Management:**

"Our IT Project Management Services are for specific IT projects with defined scope and timelines. This is separate from ongoing support or consulting. If you have a project that needs management, that's what we'd focus on."

**For IT Consulting:**

"Our IT Consulting Services provide independent guidance and recommendations. This is separate from ongoing support or project management. If you need advice to make decisions, that's what we'd focus on."

### Handling Overlap Without Bundling

**When Prospects Mix Services:**

**Scenario 1: "We need support and a project"**

Response: "I understand you have both ongoing support needs and a project. These are separate services. Which one is the priority right now? We can start with that, and if you need the other service later, we can discuss it as a separate engagement."

**Scenario 2: "We need consulting and then support"**

Response: "I understand you're looking at consulting first and then potentially support. That makes sense. Let's focus on the consulting engagement first. If you decide you need ongoing support after that, we can discuss it as a separate service."

**Scenario 3: "Can you do both?"**

Response: "We offer both services, but they're separate engagements. Each service has its own scope and agreement. We can start with whichever one addresses your most immediate need, and if you need the other service, we can discuss it separately."

**Scenario 4: "We want everything"**

Response: "I appreciate that you have multiple needs. Our services are designed to be independent so you can choose exactly what you need. Let's identify which service addresses your most urgent challenge first, and we can discuss other services separately if needed."

### Deflection Language

**When Prospects Request Bundling:**

- "We structure our services independently so you can choose exactly what you need. Each service has its own scope and agreement."
- "We don't bundle services, but we can discuss each one separately based on your priorities."
- "Let's focus on the service that addresses your most immediate need first. If you need other services, we can discuss them as separate engagements."

**When Prospects Assume Follow-On Work:**

- "Consulting provides recommendations, and there's no obligation to implement them or use our other services."
- "We can discuss other services if you need them, but each service is independent."
- "Let's complete this engagement first, and if you need additional services, we can discuss them separately."

**When Prospects Want to Combine Services:**

- "Each service is designed to stand on its own. We can discuss multiple services, but they would be separate engagements."
- "We structure services independently so you can choose what you need without being locked into services you don't need."

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Script 1

- First call with a new prospect
- Initial discovery conversations
- When you need to understand the prospect's situation
- Before determining which service applies

### When to Use Script 2

- After initial discovery is complete
- When you need to route to a specific service
- When prospects mention multiple needs
- When service boundaries need clarification

### General Principles

- **Listen more than you talk**
- **Ask questions, don't propose solutions**
- **Qualify before routing**
- **Protect boundaries, don't bundle**
- **One service per engagement**
- **No pressure, no hype**

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Prospects who want to bundle services → Route to one service
- Prospects who assume follow-on work → Clarify independence
- Prospects who want pricing before qualification → Complete discovery first
- Prospects who want solutions before understanding needs → Ask more questions

## Notes

- These scripts are guides, not rigid scripts. Adapt language to your natural speaking style.
- The goal is qualification and routing, not selling.
- If a prospect isn't a fit, it's better to say so than to force a fit.
- Service boundaries protect both Paxi Technologies and the client.
