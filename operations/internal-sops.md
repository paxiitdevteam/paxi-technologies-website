# Paxi Technologies - Internal Standard Operating Procedures

## Purpose of SOPs

### Why SOPs Exist

These Standard Operating Procedures ensure consistent service delivery across all Paxi Technologies engagements. They define how services are delivered, what is included and excluded, and how to handle common situations.

SOPs protect service boundaries, ensure accountability, and make service delivery repeatable and predictable.

### Who Uses Them

- Service delivery staff
- Project managers
- Consultants
- Operations managers
- Leadership for escalation decisions

These procedures are internal only and are not shared with clients.

---

## Service Delivery Principles

### Accountability

- One person is accountable for each service engagement
- Accountability is clearly defined at engagement start
- Accountability does not transfer without explicit handoff

### Clear Scope

- Every engagement begins with clearly defined scope
- Scope boundaries are documented and communicated
- Work outside scope requires separate agreement

### Documentation

- All work is documented appropriately for the service type
- Documentation supports continuity and accountability
- Documentation is maintained throughout engagement

### Predictability

- Services follow defined processes
- Clients know what to expect
- Delivery is consistent across engagements

**Priority Levels:**

- Critical: Complete business disruption
- High: Significant productivity impact
- Standard: Individual user or non-critical function affected
- Low: Minor issues or requests

### Response Expectations

**Response Times:**

- Critical: Defined response time (e.g., 1 hour)
- High: Defined response time (e.g., 4 hours)
- Standard: Defined response time (e.g., 1 business day)
- Low: Defined response time (e.g., 2 business days)

Response time is measured from request receipt until initial response is provided.

---

## Cross-Service Rules and Escalation

### One Service Per Engagement

**Rule:**

- Each engagement covers one service only
- IT Support Services, IT Project Management Services, and IT Consulting Services are separate
- Do not combine services in single engagement

**Application:**

- Support engagement does not include projects or consulting
- Project engagement does not include ongoing support or consulting
- Consulting engagement does not include implementation or support

### How to Handle Service Overlap

**When Client Needs Multiple Services:**

**Scenario 1: Support and Project**

- Start with most urgent need
- Complete one service engagement
- If other service needed, discuss as separate engagement
- Do not bundle or combine

**Scenario 2: Consulting Then Implementation**

- Complete consulting engagement first
- Deliver recommendations
- If client wants implementation, discuss project management as separate engagement
- No assumption of follow-on work

**Scenario 3: Project Then Support**

- Complete project engagement
- Close project properly
- If ongoing support needed, discuss support services as separate engagement
- Do not transition project into support without new agreement

**Handling Approach:**

- Acknowledge multiple needs
- Identify most urgent priority
- Focus on one service at a time
- Discuss other services separately if needed

### When to Stop and Re-Scope

**Stop Work When:**

- Request is outside defined scope
- Request requires different service type
- Scope is expanding without approval
- Client expectations don't match agreement

**Re-Scope Process:**

1. Identify scope issue
2. Stop work on out-of-scope items
3. Document scope discrepancy
4. Discuss with client
5. Either:
   - Return to original scope, or
   - Create separate engagement for new scope

**Do Not:**

- Continue work outside scope
- Assume scope expansion is acceptable
- Mix services without separate agreements

### Escalation to Leadership

**Escalate When:**

- Service boundaries are unclear
- Client requests service bundling
- Scope disputes cannot be resolved
- Service overlap creates confusion
- Client expectations don't match service capabilities

**Escalation Process:**

1. Document the situation
2. Attempt resolution at service level first
3. If unresolved, escalate to operations manager
4. If still unresolved, escalate to leadership
5. Document escalation and resolution

**Escalation Documentation:**

- Situation description
- Attempted resolutions
- Client position
- Recommended path forward
- Leadership decision and rationale

---

## Service Boundary Protection

### Boundary Violations to Prevent

**Support Service Boundaries:**

- Do not perform project work under support agreement
- Do not provide consulting under support agreement
- Do not accept project requests as support requests
- Escalate if request is project or consulting work

**Project Management Boundaries:**

- Do not perform technical execution
- Do not provide ongoing support
- Do not provide consulting assessments
- Escalate if client expects execution or support

**Consulting Boundaries:**

- Do not implement recommendations
- Do not manage projects
- Do not provide ongoing support
- Escalate if client expects implementation or management

### Boundary Language

**When Client Requests Out-of-Scope Work:**

- "That work is outside the scope of [current service]. We can discuss [other service] as a separate engagement."
- "That's a different service. Let's complete [current service] first, and we can discuss [other service] separately."
- "Our [current service] covers [scope]. For [requested work], we'd need a separate [other service] engagement."

**When Client Assumes Follow-On Work:**

- "There's no obligation to use our other services. You can implement recommendations independently or with other providers."
- "Each service is independent. We can discuss other services if you need them, but they're separate engagements."
