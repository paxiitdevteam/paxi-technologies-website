        <div class="container">
            <h2>Three Ways We Help Your Business</h2>
            <p>Paxi Technologies offers three independent IT services designed to address different aspects of your technology needs. Each service can be used independently or combined to create a comprehensive IT solution tailored to your business.</p>
            <p>Whether you need ongoing support, help managing a specific project, or guidance on technology decisions, we have a service that fits. Our approach is flexible—you choose the services that match your current needs, and we adapt as your business grows.</p>
            <ul class="service-list">
                <li><strong>IT Support Services</strong> keep your systems running day-to-day. From troubleshooting technical issues to maintaining your network infrastructure, we provide reliable support that keeps your business operating without interruption. Our team responds quickly to problems and works proactively to prevent issues before they impact your operations.</li>
                <li><strong>IT Project Management Services</strong> ensure your IT projects are completed successfully. When you're implementing new systems, upgrading infrastructure, or coordinating multiple vendors, we take ownership of project planning, coordination, and oversight. You get a single point of accountability and clear visibility into project progress.</li>
                <li><strong>IT Consulting Services</strong> help you make informed decisions about your technology. Before you invest in new systems or make significant technology changes, we provide independent assessments and recommendations. Our consulting helps you avoid costly mistakes and choose solutions that align with your business goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each service follows our core principles: accountability, plain language communication, structured delivery, and a scalable approach. You get consistent quality and clear expectations, regardless of which services you use.</p>
