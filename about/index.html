                        <p>Paxi Technologies is an IT services company focused on serving small and mid-sized businesses. We understand that your business needs dependable technology support without the complexity and cost of enterprise solutions.</p>
                        <p>Our team brings years of experience working with businesses across industries, with particular expertise in healthcare IT. We've seen firsthand how technology challenges can disrupt operations, and we're here to help prevent those disruptions.</p>
                        <p>We believe that IT services should be straightforward, reliable, and tailored to your business needs.

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Mission and Approach</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to provide IT services that help your business succeed. We do this by focusing on four core principles that guide everything we do.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li><strong>Accountability</strong> - We do what we say we'll do. When we commit to a timeline, we meet it. When you have questions, we provide clear answers. You can count on us to follow through on our commitments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plain Language</strong> - Technology doesn't have to be complicated. We explain things in terms you understand, without unnecessary jargon or technical complexity. You'll know what's happening with your IT and why it matters to your business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structured Delivery</strong> - Every service follows a clear process. We document our work, communicate regularly, and maintain organized records. This structure ensures consistency and provides visibility into how we're serving your business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalable Approach</strong> - Our services adapt as your business needs change over time. Whether you're growing, changing direction, or facing new challenges, we can adjust our services to match your current situation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These principles aren't just words—they're the foundation of how we work with every client. They ensure you get consistent quality and clear expectations, regardless of which services you use.</p>
